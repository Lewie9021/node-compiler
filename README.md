# Node Compiler

Node Compiler is a flexible single page application compiler that supports a number of integrations. I found it difficult to find a module that supports the intergrations I need and therefore decided I would create my own. Using JavaScript Object Notation, users can easily configure how the compiler behaves. There are future plans to implement a graphical interface to aid the creation of the configuration object. Suggestions for other intergrations are more than welcome!
